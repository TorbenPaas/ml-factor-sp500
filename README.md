# ML Factor Investing – S&P 500 Backtest

This project implements a machine-learning-based factor investing strategy
for stocks in the S&P 500 universe. It downloads historical market data,
computes quantitative features, trains a predictive model, and evaluates
the resulting portfolio using a walk-forward backtest.

The objective is to analyze whether machine learning models can generate
risk-adjusted excess returns compared to a passive benchmark (SPY).
